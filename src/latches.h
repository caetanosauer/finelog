/**\brief Wrapper for pthread mutexes, with a queue-based lock API.
 *
 * When the storage manager is configured with the default,
 * --enable-pthread-mutex, this lock uses a Pthreads mutex for the lock.
 * In this case, it is not a true queue-based lock, since
 * release doesn't inform the next node in the queue, and in fact the
 * nodes aren't kept in a queue.
 * It just gives pthread mutexes the same API as the other
 * queue-based locks so that we use the same idioms for
 * critical sections based on different kinds of locks.
 * By configuring with pthreads mutexes implementing this class, the
 * server can spawn any number of threads, regardless of the number
 * of hardware contexts available; threads will block as necessary.
 *
 * When the storage manager is configured with
 * --disable-pthread-mutex, this lock uses an MCS (\ref MCS1) queue-based
 * lock for the lock.
 * In this case, it is a true queue-based lock.
 * By configuring with MCS locks implementing this class, if the
 * server spawn many more threads than hardware contexts, time can be wasted
 * spinning; threads will not block until the operating system (or underlying
 * thread scheduler) determines to block the thread.
 *
 * The idiom for using these locks is
 * that the qnode is on a threads's stack, so the qnode
 * implicitly identifies the owning thread.
 *
 * This allows us to add an is_mine() capability that otherwise
 * the pthread mutexen don't have.
 *
 * Finally, using this class ensures that the pthread_mutex_init/destroy
 * is done (in the --enable-pthread-mutex case).
 *
 *  See also: \ref REFSYNC
